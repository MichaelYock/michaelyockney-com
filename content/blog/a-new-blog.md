**Canonical URLs** are generated with [gatsby-plugin-react-helmet](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet) and [gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls](https://github.com/NickCis/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls). Initially I just used Helmet to add a canonical link to the SEO component, but for completeness regarding https/http, www/no-www and some edge cases, I opted not to reinvent the wheel.
